<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a graphic designer and Flutter developer, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical skills to the table. 
  With a passion for design and an insatiable curiosity for technology, I have honed my skills in both fields to create 
  visually appealing and functional applications. I have experience in designing graphics for various projects and have 
  built multiple Flutter applications integrated with APIs, voice assistants, machine learning, and blockchain technology.
   Winning hackathons has been one of my proudest accomplishments. I am committed to continuous learning and growth and am 
   actively seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and make a positive impact on society. Let's connect and collaborate 
   to create innovative solutions that can make a difference in the world.</p>
  <p>As a technical deputy secretary at the Student Council of Terna Engineering College, Navi Mumbai, I had the opportunity 
    to organize several technical events and workshops. One of my notable accomplishments was organizing the "Hackformers" hackathon,
     which received over 700 applications and had more than 100 participants. This event provided a platform for students to showcase
      their technical skills and creativity in solving real-world problems. Through my leadership and organizational skills, we were 
      able to execute a successful hackathon that received positive feedback from both participants and judges. Overall, this 
      experience helped me further develop my leadership and technical abilities while contributing to the growth and development 
      of the student community.</p>
